                    Ekac Development NPO was established in 2016, the organisation's core functions are Agriculture, Soccer, Feeding Scheme and Social Issues. We have successfully been educating the youth of Meadowlands on how to plant their own food and giving back with
                    the same food we planted, and we manage to give young boys a place of belonging in our soccer team and removing them from the streets where they would be exposed to drugs and all the negative things that affect young people. The Organisation
                    has a positive impact in Meadowlands youth, their families and community at large.
